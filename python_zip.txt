I understand that you need help with zipping files in /tmp before uploading to S3. Please let me know if I'm missing something.

I did a test from my end using Python and was successfully able to zip a file in tmp directory and then upload to S3 bucket.

Here's code sample for your reference [1] [2]:

import os 
import boto3

from zipfile import ZipFile

def writeZip():
    
    # Create a new file
    f = open("/tmp/myfile.txt", "x")
    f.write("Now the file has more content!")
    f.close()    
    
    # List tmp dir
    print(os.listdir("/tmp"))
    
    # Zip file
    with ZipFile('/tmp/my_python_files.zip','w') as zip:
    # writing each file one by one
        zip.write("/tmp/myfile.txt")
        
    # List tmp dir
    print(os.listdir("/tmp"))
    

def upload_file(file_name, bucket, object_name=None):
    
    if object_name is None:
        object_name = file_name

    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
    
    response = s3_client.upload_file(file_name, bucket, object_name)
    
    print(response)


def lambda_handler(event, context):
    
    writeZip()
    
    upload_file("/tmp/my_python_files.zip", "bk-automating-aws-boto3")
    
    return "Success"

Make sure you have the necessary permissions on both Lambda and S3 for uploading to S3 bucket [3].

Please note that code support is out of scope and above code sample if for reference purpose only.

I'm also sharing the useful resources for your reference.

I hope this helps and please let me know if you have any questions.

Have a good day!
